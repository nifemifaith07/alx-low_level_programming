# Learning Objectives
    What are nested loops and how to use them
    What is a function and how do you use functions
    What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
    What is a prototype
    Scope of variables
    What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
    What are header files and how to to use them with #include

# Requirements
    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options *-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89*
    code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    Not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
    You are allowed to use _putchar(https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
    The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
TASKS
# 0. _putchar
*Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.*
*The program should return 0*
